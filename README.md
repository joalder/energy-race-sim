# energy-race-sim

## ideas

- Full history of steps which allows to move back/forward in time (e.g. using command pattern)
- Charting of statistics over time
- Run multiple cars at the same time
- Adjust parameters mid simulation
- Allow running in variable time, real time to full speed
- Simulate actual track with height profile, corner speeds, ...
- More sophisticated energy simulation like acceleration, regen, electrical resistance, rotational mass, brake vs. regen
- Additional environment parameters like temperature, wetness, ...
- Visualize track and locations
